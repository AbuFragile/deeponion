1.  Clone the github tree to get the source code:

git clone --recursive https://github.com/deeponion/deeponion.git

2.  Download and install Brew for Mac (https://brew.sh)

2.  Install dependencies with Brew

brew install boost@1.57 --cc=clang 
brew link boost
brew install berkeley-db@4 
brew install openssl 
brew install miniupnpc
brew install qt5  [only use if building the Wallet UI]
brew install qrencode [only use if building the Wallet UI]

3.  Now you should be able to build DeepOnion:

cd deeponion
./autogen.sh
configure --with-gui=qt5 --disable-tests [or use --without-gui if only building the daemon]
make

4. Outputs
The daemon will be located under src/DeepOniond, the Wallet UI under src/qt/DeepOnion-qt.

Run:
  ./DeepOniond --help  # for a list of command-line options.
Run
  ./DeepOniond -daemon # to start the DeepOnion daemon.
Run
  ./DeepOniond help # When the daemon is running, to get a list of RPC commands
run
